NAME

      gcloud compute target-http-proxies update - update a target HTTP proxy

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute target-http-proxies update NAME [--format FORMAT] [--help]
         [--log-http] [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q]
         [--trace-token TRACE_TOKEN] --url-map URL_MAP [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute target-http-proxies update is used to change the URL map of
      existing target HTTP proxies. A target HTTP proxy is referenced by one or
      more forwarding rules which define which packets the proxy is responsible
      for routing. The target HTTP proxy in turn points to a URL map that
      defines the rules for routing the requests. The URL map's job is to map
      URLs to backend services which handle the actual requests.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the target HTTP proxy.

FLAGS

      --url-map URL_MAP

         A reference to a URL map resource that will define the mapping of URLs
         to backend services. The URL map must exist and cannot be deleted while
         referenced by a target HTTP proxy.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --log-http

         Logs all HTTP server requests and responses to stderr.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
