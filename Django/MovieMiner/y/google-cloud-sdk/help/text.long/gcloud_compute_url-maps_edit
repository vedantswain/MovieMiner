DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute url-maps edit can be used to modify a URL map. The URL map
      resource is fetched from the server and presented in a text editor. After
      the file is saved and closed, this command will update the resource. Only
      fields that can be modified are displayed in the editor.

      The editor used to modify the resource is chosen by inspecting the EDITOR
      environment variable.

         text, yaml.

         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

         issues.
