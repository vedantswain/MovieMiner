NAME

      gcloud components reinstall - reinstall the Cloud SDK with the same
         components you have now

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud components reinstall [--format FORMAT] [--help] [--log-http]
         [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q] [--trace-token TRACE_TOKEN] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      If your Cloud SDK installation becomes corrupt, this command attempts to
      fix it by downloading the latest version of the Cloud SDK and reinstalling
      it. This will replace your existing installation with a fresh one. The
      command is the equivalent of deleting your current installation,
      downloading a fresh copy of the SDK, and installing in the same location.

FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --log-http

         Logs all HTTP server requests and responses to stderr.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      --trace-token TRACE_TOKEN

         Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
         issues.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK core component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
